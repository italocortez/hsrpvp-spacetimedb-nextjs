# Views

**Architecture:** [architecture.md](architecture.md)

## Feature Overview

Views are server-side computed projections that replace direct table subscriptions for clients. They enforce three security layers: (1) per-user data scoping so clients only receive rows they are authorized to see, (2) anonymous identity enforcement that masks opponent user IDs in anonymous lobbies (D-92), and (3) history visibility gating that prevents tournament scouting by hiding match history until tournaments complete (D-93). Clients always subscribe to views, never raw tables -- no conditional branching on the frontend.

## Naming Convention

| Prefix | Scope | Examples |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `view_my_*` | Strictly scoped to the caller's own data or the caller's current lobbies | `view_my_lobbies`, `view_my_lobby_chat`, `view_my_match_steps` |
| `view_*` (no "my") | Caller's data **plus** publicly visible data | `view_match_history`, `view_match_participant_history` |
| `view_*` (anonymous) | No authentication required; accessible to all clients | `view_lobby_browser`, `view_user_directory` |

The `view_my_*` prefix guarantees the caller never sees another user's private data. Views without "my" combine caller-participated rows with publicly visible rows.

## Views

### view_lobby_browser

**Purpose:** Projected lobby list for the lobby browser UI -- excludes config details and Finished lobbies.

**Type:** `anonymousView` -- no authentication required.

**Row type:** `LobbyBrowserRow` (projected struct, not raw Lobby row).

**Flow:**
1. Scan Lobby table using `stage` btree index for 4 active stages (Waiting, Drafting, Equipping, Scoring)
2. Exclude all Finished lobbies (D-08)
3. Resolve `tournamentName` via `Tournament.id` PK lookup when `tournamentId` is set
4. Resolve `costSetName` via `CostSet.id` PK lookup when `costSetId > 0`
5. Return projected columns only: id, joinCode, gameMode, draftMode, matchType, currentPlayerCount, isTournamentControlled, isAnonymousPlayers, stage, isPublic, teamSize, tournamentName?, costSetName?

**Excluded data:** Timer settings, budget values, penalty settings, disconnect policy, audit columns (createdDate, updatedDate), rosterVisibility, hostId, all internal IDs except lobby id.

### view_my_lobbies

**Purpose:** Full Lobby rows for lobbies the caller is currently a member of.

**Type:** `view` -- requires authentication.

**Flow:**
1. Resolve `ctx.sender` -> `UserIdentity.identity` PK -> `userId`
2. Look up `LobbyMember.user_id` btree index for caller's memberships
3. Fetch each `Lobby.id` PK lookup (users are in at most 1-2 lobbies per enforcement rules)
4. Return full Lobby rows

**Returns:** Empty array if caller has no `UserIdentity` mapping.

### view_my_identity

**Purpose:** Caller's own `UserIdentity` row only.

**Type:** `view` -- requires authentication.

**Flow:**
1. PK lookup on `UserIdentity.identity` using `ctx.sender`
2. Return single row or undefined

**Returns:** `option(UserIdentity.rowType)` -- at most one row. Prevents identity enumeration by limiting broadcast to the caller's own mapping.

### view_my_profile

**Purpose:** Caller's own full `User` row.

**Type:** `view` -- requires authentication.

**Flow:**
1. Resolve `ctx.sender` -> `UserIdentity.identity` PK -> `userId`
2. PK lookup on `User.id`
3. Return single row or undefined

**Returns:** `option(User.rowType)`.

### view_user_directory

**Purpose:** Public user list for display name resolution.

**Type:** `anonymousView` -- no authentication required.

**Row type:** Full `User.rowType`.

**Current behavior:** Returns all User rows (stepping stone). When frontend migrates to subscribe to this view instead of the raw User table, the User table can be made `public: false`.

### view_my_cost_sets

**Purpose:** CostSet rows owned by the caller, for the TO cost set management workflow.

**Type:** `view` -- requires authentication.

**Flow:**
1. Resolve `ctx.sender` -> `UserIdentity` -> `User.id`
2. Filter `CostSet.creator_id` btree index by caller's user id
3. Return matching CostSet rows

### view_my_draft_character_costs / view_my_draft_lightcone_costs / view_my_draft_synergy_costs

**Purpose:** Draft cost tables (CostSetDraftCharacter, CostSetDraftLightcone, CostSetDraftSynergy) for cost sets owned by the caller. These tables are private (`public: false`), so views are the only client read path.

**Type:** `view` -- requires authentication.

**Flow:**
1. Resolve `ctx.sender` -> `UserIdentity` -> `User.id`
2. Get all CostSet rows owned by caller via `creator_id` index
3. For each owned cost set, filter the draft table's `cost_set_id` index
4. Return all matching draft rows

### view_my_player_stats

**Purpose:** Caller's own PlayerStat rows. PlayerStat table is private -- this view is the only client read path. (D-33)

**Type:** `view` -- requires authentication.

**Flow:**
1. Resolve `ctx.sender` -> `UserIdentity` -> `userId`
2. Filter `PlayerStat.by_user` btree index
3. Return matching rows

### view_my_character_stats

**Purpose:** Caller's own PlayerCharacterStat rows. Private table, view-only access. (D-33)

**Type:** `view` -- requires authentication.

**Flow:**
1. Resolve `ctx.sender` -> `UserIdentity` -> `userId`
2. Filter `PlayerCharacterStat.by_user` btree index
3. Return matching rows

### view_my_relationships

**Purpose:** Caller's own PlayerRelationship rows. Private table, view-only access. (D-33)

**Row type:** `RosterVisibilityRow` (custom struct: lobbyId, memberUserId, hsrAccountId, characterName, eidolonLevel, accountRating?).

**Flow:**
1. Resolve `ctx.sender` -> caller's memberships
2. For each lobby membership, determine caller's team via `slotTeam()`
3. For each member in that lobby, apply visibility rules:
   - **Referee (D-14):** sees all rosters and ratings regardless of setting
   - **Self + own team:** always see full roster and rating
   - **OpenRoster (D-11):** all rosters visible to all participants
   - **ClosedWithRating (D-12):** opponent roster hidden, opponent `accountRating` visible via sentinel row (characterName='', eidolonLevel=0)
   - **ClosedNoRating (D-13):** opponent roster AND rating hidden (no rows returned for opponent)
   - **Spectators (D-16):** follow opponent rules (not referee rules)

### view_my_lobby_chat

**Purpose:** ChatMessage rows for the caller's lobbies with anonymous enforcement. (D-92)

**Type:** `view` -- requires authentication.

**Row type:** `AnonymousChatRow` (custom struct with anonymousLabel field).

**Flow:**

### view_match_history

**Purpose:** MatchSessionHistory rows visible to the caller -- prevents tournament scouting. (D-93)

**Type:** `view` -- requires authentication. No "my" prefix because scope includes publicly visible matches.

**Flow:**
1. Call `buildVisibleMatchIds()` shared helper
2. Scan MatchSessionHistory via 3 `game_mode` btree filter calls (one per GameMode)
3. Include row if its id is in the visible set
4. Return full `MatchSessionHistory` rows

**Visibility gate (buildVisibleMatchIds):**

## Acceptance Scenarios

### Security: Caller sees only their own lobbies

**Given:** User A is a member of Lobby 1. User B is a member of Lobby 2.
**When:** User A subscribes to `view_my_lobbies`
**Then:** User A receives only Lobby 1. Lobby 2 is not included.

### Security: Caller sees only their own identity

**Given:** User A and User B both have UserIdentity rows.
**When:** User A subscribes to `view_my_identity`
**Then:** User A receives only their own UserIdentity row.

### Security: Caller sees only their own stats

**Given:** User A has PlayerStat rows. User B has PlayerStat rows.
**When:** User A subscribes to `view_my_player_stats`
**Then:** User A receives only their own PlayerStat rows.

### Security: Lobby browser excludes Finished lobbies

**Given:** 3 lobbies exist: Lobby 1 (Waiting), Lobby 2 (Finished), Lobby 3 (Drafting).
**When:** Any client subscribes to `view_lobby_browser`
**Then:** Only Lobby 1 and Lobby 3 are returned. Lobby 2 (Finished) is excluded.

### Security: Lobby browser excludes config details

**Given:** Lobby exists with timer, budget, penalty, and disconnect settings configured.
**When:** Client subscribes to `view_lobby_browser`
**Then:** Response contains only projected fields (id, joinCode, gameMode, etc.). No timer/budget/penalty/disconnect/audit columns.

### Security: Unauthenticated caller sees anonymous views

**Given:** An unauthenticated client connects.
**When:** Client subscribes to `view_lobby_browser` and `view_user_directory`
**Then:** Both views return data (anonymousView type requires no authentication).

### Security: Unauthenticated caller gets nothing from per-user views

**Given:** An unauthenticated client connects.
**When:** Client subscribes to `view_my_lobbies`
**Then:** Returns empty -- no `ctx.sender` resolution possible.

### Anonymous: Non-anonymous lobby returns real data

**Given:** Lobby with `isAnonymousPlayers=false`, `isAnonymousSpectators=false`. Players A (Blue) and B (Red) are members.
**When:** Player A subscribes to `view_my_lobby_members`
**Then:** Both members returned with real `userId` and `displayName`. No `anonymousLabel` set.

### Anonymous: Opponent userId masked in anonymous lobby

**Given:** Lobby with `isAnonymousPlayers=true`. Players A (Blue-1) and B (Red-1) are members.
**When:** Player A subscribes to `view_my_lobby_members`
**Then:** Player A's row: real `userId`, real `displayName`. Player B's row: `userId=0`, `displayName="Red-1"`, `anonymousLabel="Red-1"`.

### Anonymous: Own identity never anonymized

**Given:** Lobby with `isAnonymousPlayers=true`. Player A is Blue-1.
**When:** Player A subscribes to `view_my_lobby_members`
**Then:** Player A's own row always has real `userId` and real `displayName`, regardless of anonymous settings.

### Anonymous: Same team sees real identities (D-70)

**Given:** Lobby with `isAnonymousPlayers=true`, teamSize=2. Players A and B on Blue team.
**When:** Player A subscribes to `view_my_lobby_members`
**Then:** Player B's row has real `userId` and real `displayName` (same team = not anonymized).

### Anonymous: Spectator sees all players anonymized (D-70)

**Given:** Lobby with `isAnonymousPlayers=true`. Spectator S watches. Players A (Blue) and B (Red).
**When:** Spectator S subscribes to `view_my_lobby_members`
**Then:** Both Player A and Player B rows have `userId=0` with anonymous labels.

### Anonymous: Spectator referee sees real identities (D-71)

**Given:** Lobby with `isAnonymousPlayers=true`. Referee R is a spectator with `isReferee=true`.
**When:** Referee R subscribes to `view_my_lobby_members`
**Then:** All members returned with real `userId` and real `displayName`.

### Anonymous: System messages never anonymized

**Given:** Lobby with `isAnonymousPlayers=true`. System message exists with `senderType=System`.
**When:** Player subscribes to `view_my_lobby_chat`
**Then:** System message has real `senderUserId`, no `anonymousLabel`.

### Anonymous: Chat uses pre-stored label

**Given:** Lobby with `isAnonymousPlayers=true`. ChatMessage row has `anonymousLabel="Red-1"` stored at write time.
**When:** Opponent subscribes to `view_my_lobby_chat`
**Then:** Message returned with `senderUserId=0`, `anonymousLabel="Red-1"` (from stored value, not recomputed).

### Anonymous: Match steps anonymize opponent actors

**Given:** Lobby with `isAnonymousPlayers=true`. Step row has `actorUserId=5` (opponent) with pre-stored `anonymousLabel="Red-1"`.
**When:** Blue player subscribes to `view_my_match_steps`
**Then:** Step returned with `actorUserId=0`, `anonymousLabel="Red-1"`.

### Anonymous: Match participants anonymize opponents

**Given:** Lobby with `isAnonymousPlayers=true`. MatchResultParticipant for opponent userId=5.
**When:** Blue player subscribes to `view_my_match_participants`
**Then:** Opponent participant returned with `userId=0`, `anonymousLabel` computed via `computeAnonymousLabel()`.

### Anonymous Label Format

**Given:** Lobby with anonymous mode. Members joined in order: Blue player 1, Blue player 2, Red player 1, Coach Blue.
**When:** Labels computed via `computeAnonymousLabel()`
**Then:** Labels are: "Blue-1", "Blue-2", "Red-1", "Coach-Blue". Labels are deterministic based on team side and join order (createdDate ascending).

### History: Publicly visible match accessible to non-participant

**Given:** MatchSessionHistory row with `isPubliclyVisible=true`. User C did not participate.
**When:** User C subscribes to `view_match_history`
**Then:** Match is included in results.

### History: Non-public match hidden from non-participant

**Given:** MatchSessionHistory row with `isPubliclyVisible=false` (active tournament match). User C did not participate.
**When:** User C subscribes to `view_match_history`
**Then:** Match is NOT included in results.

### History: Participant sees their own non-public match

**Given:** MatchSessionHistory row with `isPubliclyVisible=false`. User A participated (has MatchParticipantHistory row).
**When:** User A subscribes to `view_match_history`
**Then:** Match IS included in results (participant override).

### History: Tournament reveal makes matches public

**Given:** Tournament completes. `revealTournamentHistory` sets `isPubliclyVisible=true` on all tournament matches. (D-84)
**When:** Any user subscribes to `view_match_history`
**Then:** All completed tournament matches now visible to everyone.

### History: Consistent gate across all three history views

**Given:** Match X is visible (either public or participant). Match Y is hidden.
**When:** User subscribes to `view_match_history`, `view_match_participant_history`, and `view_match_step_history`
**Then:** All three views return data for Match X. None return data for Match Y. The `buildVisibleMatchIds()` helper ensures consistency.

### Roster: OpenRoster shows all rosters (D-11)

**Given:** Lobby with `rosterVisibility=OpenRoster`. Players A (Blue) and B (Red).
**When:** Player A subscribes to `view_my_roster_visibility`
**Then:** Both Player A's and Player B's full character roster returned with ratings.

### Roster: ClosedWithRating hides roster, shows rating (D-12)

**Given:** Lobby with `rosterVisibility=ClosedWithRating`. Opponent B has 3 characters and accountRating=1500.
**When:** Player A subscribes to `view_my_roster_visibility`
**Then:** Player A sees own full roster. For opponent B: one sentinel row per account (characterName='', eidolonLevel=0, accountRating=1500). No character data.

### Roster: ClosedNoRating hides everything (D-13)

**Given:** Lobby with `rosterVisibility=ClosedNoRating`. Opponent B exists.
**When:** Player A subscribes to `view_my_roster_visibility`
**Then:** Player A sees own full roster. No rows returned for opponent B at all.

### Roster: Referee sees all (D-14)

**Given:** Lobby with `rosterVisibility=ClosedNoRating`. Referee R is a spectator.
**When:** Referee R subscribes to `view_my_roster_visibility`
**Then:** All members' full rosters and ratings visible regardless of setting.
