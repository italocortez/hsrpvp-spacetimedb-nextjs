# Calendar & Scheduling

## Feature Overview

Players can record recurring availability windows, bookmark other players' calendars to find common free time, and create calendar events with invites. Tournament organizers can schedule matches by creating events linked to bracket matches, with auto-invite of match participants. All calendar data is public. Common availability computation happens client-side from subscription data.

## Cascade Cleanup (Cross-Feature)

3. Delete CalendarEventInvite rows for each found event
4. Delete CalendarEvent rows

### rollback_bracket_match / dq_participant (extend)

When a bracket match is rolled back or a participant is DQ'd, delete the linked CalendarEvent + invites if one exists.

### withdraw_from_tournament (extend)

When a player withdraws from a tournament, delete their CalendarEventInvite rows for any CalendarEvents linked to that tournament's bracket matches.

### UserDeletionJob (extend)

When a user account is deleted, cascade-delete all calendar data:
1. Delete user's AvailabilitySlot rows
2. Delete SavedCalendar rows where userId = user (bookmarks they created)
3. Delete SavedCalendar rows where targetUserId = user (bookmarks of them)
4. Delete CalendarEventInvite rows where inviteeUserId = user

**Then:** Old events + their invites silently deleted before the main operation

### Lazy Cleanup of Expired Slots

**When:** User calls any calendar reducer
**Then:** Expired slots silently deleted before the main operation

## Edge Cases

| Case | Expected Behavior | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Guest creates slot/event/save | Rejected with guest-specific error | All calendar reducers require authentication |
| Invitee responds with Pending status | Rejected | Pending is initial state, not a valid response |
| Organizer invites self | Allowed but unusual | No explicit guard — organizer may want to track their own RSVP |
| bracketMatchId points to deleted match | Rejected: match not found | Validated at creation time |
| Monthly recurrence on day 31 | Client clamps to last day of month (e.g., Feb 28/29) | Server stores original dayOfMonth=31 |
| Overlapping availability slots | Allowed | Slots are advisory, no server-side overlap validation |
| Event with 0 invitees | Allowed — treated as blocked/personal time | No invites required |
| Update event with bracketMatchId | bracketMatchId is immutable after creation | Delete and recreate to change link |
| All timestamps | UTC — frontend handles timezone conversion | Consistent with all other tables |
| Changing all caps (10 slots, 40 events, 5 calendars, 9 invites) | Update reducer logic and republish | No --clear-database needed |

## Integration Points

| This Feature | Connects To | How | Direction |
|-------------|------------|-----|-----------|
| CalendarEvent.bracketMatchId | BracketMatch.id | FK reference | Reads |
| CalendarEvent.organizerId | User.id | FK reference | Reads |
| CalendarEventInvite.inviteeUserId | User.id | FK reference | Reads |
| Auto-invite | BracketMatch → TournamentTeam → TournamentParticipant | Participant lookup chain | Reads |
| cancel_tournament cascade | CalendarEvent + CalendarEventInvite | Cleanup linked events | Writes (delete) |
| rollback_bracket_match cascade | CalendarEvent + CalendarEventInvite | Cleanup linked event | Writes (delete) |
| dq_participant cascade | CalendarEvent + CalendarEventInvite | Cleanup linked event | Writes (delete) |
| withdraw_from_tournament cascade | CalendarEventInvite | Cleanup player's invites | Writes (delete) |
| UserDeletionJob cascade | All 4 calendar tables | Full user data cleanup | Writes (delete) |
| SavedCalendar | AvailabilitySlot (client-side) | Subscription routing: client reads saved userIds, subscribes to their slots | Reads (client) |
