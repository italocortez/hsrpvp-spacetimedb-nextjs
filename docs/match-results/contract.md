# Match Results

**Architecture:** [architecture.md](architecture.md)

## Feature Overview

Match results manage the full lifecycle of determining a match outcome: per-game score entry, captain confirmation, referee submission, dispute handling, and finalization that writes stats and MMR. Casual matches auto-validate on submit and auto-finalize inline. Ranked matches go through a two-step flow: submission by referee puts the result in Submitted status; a moderator, referee, or tournament organizer then validates it. Admin tools handle exceptional cases: force-finalization of stuck matches, voiding matches without stats, setting bracket winners post-rollback, and overriding disputed results.

## Reducers

### record_game_scores

**Purpose:** Record or update per-game scores for a match result. Composite PK upsert (delete + insert on existing row).

**Permission:** Participant captain (own side only) OR spectator referee with `refereeFullControl=true` (both sides)

**Parameters:**
| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| matchResultId | u32 | Yes | Target MatchResultRecord |
| gameNumber | u8 | Yes | Game number (1-based) |
| winnerTeamSide | string | Yes | "Blue" or "Red" |
| teamBlueCyclesUsed | u32? | No | Blue team cycle count |
| teamRedCyclesUsed | u32? | No | Red team cycle count |
| teamBlueScore | u64? | No | Blue team score |
| teamRedScore | u64? | No | Red team score |
| teamBlueBoss1Score | u64? | No | Blue boss 1 score |
| teamBlueBoss2Score | u64? | No | Blue boss 2 score |
| teamRedBoss1Score | u64? | No | Red boss 1 score |
| teamRedBoss2Score | u64? | No | Red boss 2 score |
| teamBlueScreenshotUrl | string? | No | Blue screenshot URL |
| teamRedScreenshotUrl | string? | No | Red screenshot URL |

**Flow:**
1. Authenticate caller via `getAuthenticatedUser(ctx)`
2. Look up `MatchResultRecord` by id; throw if not found
3. Validate status is `Pending`; throw if not
4. Liveness guard: `ensureMatchAlive` — blocks scoring after concede
5. Validate `winnerTeamSide` is "Blue" or "Red"
6. Authority check:
   - If participant: must be `isCaptain=true`; Blue captain rejects Red-side fields, Red captain rejects Blue-side fields
   - If non-participant: must be `isReferee=true` on the lobby AND `matchResult.refereeFullControl=true`
7. Upsert `MatchResultGame` row: if row exists for `[matchResultId, gameNumber]`, delete then insert (composite PK); otherwise insert fresh

**Expected State Changes:**
- `MatchResultGame` row inserted or replaced for `[matchResultId, gameNumber]`

**Error Cases:**
| Condition | Error Message |
|-----------|--------------|
| Match result not found | "Match result not found." |
| Status is not Pending | "Scores can only be recorded when the match is in Pending status." |
| `winnerTeamSide` invalid | "winnerTeamSide must be \"Blue\" or \"Red\"." |
| Caller not captain | "Only the team captain can record game scores." |
| Blue captain provides Red-side fields | "Captains can only enter scores for their own side." |
| Non-participant, not referee | "You are not a participant or authorized referee of this match." |
| Non-participant referee, no `refereeFullControl` | "You are not a participant or authorized referee of this match." |
| Associated lobby not found | "Associated lobby not found." |

## Acceptance Scenarios

### Happy Path: Captain Records and Confirms Scores, Referee Submits

**Given:** MatchResultRecord in Pending status, Blue captain and Red captain exist
**When:** Blue captain calls `record_game_scores(matchResultId, 1, "Blue", ...)`, Red captain records their side, both call `confirm_match_scores`, referee calls `submit_match_result(matchResultId, blueCaptainId)`
**Then:** MatchResultRecord transitions to Validated (Casual) or Submitted (Ranked). Lobby stage → AwaitingResult.

### Casual Match Auto-Finalizes

**Given:** Casual MatchResultRecord, both sides confirmed
**When:** Referee calls `submit_match_result`
**Then:** Status → Validated, `runFinalization` runs inline. Stats written. Lobby hard-deleted.

### Dispute After Submission

**Given:** Ranked MatchResultRecord in Submitted status
**When:** Participant calls `dispute_match_result(matchResultId, "Scores are wrong")`
**Then:** Status → Disputed. `disputedByUserId`, `disputeReason` set.

### Admin Force-Finalizes Stuck Match

**Given:** Lobby in AwaitingResult, `mmrProcessedAt` is undefined
**When:** Moderator calls `admin_force_finalize(lobbyId, winnerTeamId)`
**Then:** MatchResultRecord status → Validated with winner. Full finalization runs.

### Admin Voids a Match

**Given:** Lobby in AwaitingResult, `mmrProcessedAt` is undefined
**When:** Moderator calls `admin_void_match(lobbyId)`
**Then:** Lobby and all MatchResult* rows hard-deleted. No stats written.

### Spectator Referee Records Both Sides

**Given:** `refereeFullControl=true` on MatchResultRecord, spectator referee in lobby
**When:** Referee calls `record_game_scores` with both Blue and Red fields
**Then:** MatchResultGame row inserted for both sides. Referee may also call `confirm_match_scores` to confirm both sides at once.

### Ranked Override (Disputed Match)

**Given:** Ranked MatchResultRecord in Disputed status
**When:** Moderator calls `override_match_result(matchResultId, "Validated", "Blue", "Screenshot confirms Blue win")`
**Then:** Status → Validated, winnerTeamSide=Blue, matchEndReason=Completed, disputeReason set.

## Edge Cases

| Case | Expected Behavior | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| `winnerId=0` on submit | Draw: no `winnerTeamSide` set, `matchEndReason=Draw` | 0 is sentinel for draw |
| Submit before both sides confirmed | Rejected: "All team captains must confirm scores..." | Both flags required |
| Dispute already-disputed match | Rejected: "This match result has already been disputed." | Idempotent check |
| Captain tries to enter opponent's scores | Rejected: "Captains can only enter scores for their own side." | Side isolation |
| Force-finalize already processed match | Rejected: "This match has already been processed..." | `mmrProcessedAt` guard |
| Void already processed match | Rejected: "This match has already been processed. Cannot void." | Same guard |
| `admin_set_bracket_winner` before rollback | Rejected: "Bracket match already has a winner." | Must rollback first |
| Override non-tournament match as non-moderator | Rejected by `ensureModerator` | Tournament vs non-tournament permission split |
| Ranked override without screenshots | Rejected: "Cannot validate Ranked match: game N is missing screenshot(s)." | All games must have both URLs |
