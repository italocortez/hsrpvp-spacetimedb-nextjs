# Match Session (Draft System)

**Architecture:** [architecture.md](architecture.md)

## Feature Overview

The match session system manages the entire draft lifecycle within a lobby: character bans, character picks (Classic mode), character auctions (Auction mode), lightcone equipping, lineup arrangement, and stage advancement through Drafting, Equipping, and Scoring. It enforces turn order, budget constraints, timer expiry, pause/resume, and referee undo. Coaches are blocked from all draft and equip actions. Captains (or sole players when no captain is assigned) are the only team members who can perform draft actions.

## Reducers

### start_draft

**Purpose:** Creates the MatchSession, MatchResultRecord, and MatchResultParticipant rows, assigns auto-captains, and transitions the lobby from Waiting to Drafting.

**Permission:** Host, Admin, or Moderator (ensureHostOrAbove)

**Parameters:**
| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| lobbyId | u32 | Yes | Target lobby ID |

**Flow:**
1. Authenticate caller; verify host/admin/moderator permission on the lobby
2. Verify lobby is in `Waiting` stage
3. Gather all Blue+Red members; filter to non-coach players only
4. Reject if any non-coach player is not confirmed (D-29)
5. Reject if either team has zero non-coach players
6. If `autoRandomPick=true`, validate every non-coach player has an active HSR account with at least one character (D-43b)
7. Build draft sequence: Classic mode uses `buildClassicSequence(banMode)`, Auction mode uses `buildAuctionBanSequence(banMode)` (ban steps only)
8. Auto-assign captains (D-30): for each team, if no player has `isCaptain=true`, set the first non-coach player as captain
9. Insert `MatchSession` row with initial budgets from lobby settings, `turnIndex=0`, timer initialized
10. Determine `refereeFullControl` from referee's slot (spectator slot = full control, team slot = false) (D-44)
11. Insert `MatchResultRecord` with `status=Pending`
12. Insert `MatchResultParticipant` rows for every non-coach Blue+Red member (re-reads members to capture updated isCaptain)
13. Transition lobby stage to `Drafting`
14. Insert system chat message: "Draft has started!"

**Expected State Changes:**
- `MatchSession` inserted (lobbyId PK)
- `MatchResultRecord` inserted (autoInc id)
- `MatchResultParticipant` rows inserted (one per non-coach team member)
- `LobbyMember.isCaptain` updated for auto-assigned captains
- `Lobby.stage` = Drafting
- `ChatMessage` inserted (system message)

**Error Cases:**
| Condition | Error Message |
|-----------|--------------|
| Lobby not found | "Lobby not found." |
| Caller not host/admin/mod | Permission error from ensureHostOrAbove |
| Not in Waiting stage | Stage assertion error |
| Unconfirmed non-coach player exists | "All Blue and Red players must be confirmed before starting." |
| Blue team has no non-coach players | "Blue team must have at least one non-coach player." |
| Red team has no non-coach players | "Red team must have at least one non-coach player." |
| autoRandomPick + player missing active HSR account | "Player #N has no active HSR account. autoRandomPick requires all players to have characters." |
| autoRandomPick + player has no characters | "Player #N has no characters on their active HSR account. autoRandomPick requires all players to have characters." |

**When:** Host calls `start_draft(lobbyId)`
**Then:** MatchSession created with 22-step sequence, both players auto-captained. Lobby stage = Drafting. MatchResultRecord created with status=Pending.

**When:** Blue captain calls `ban_character(lobbyId, "Kafka")`
**Then:** Ban step recorded at sequence 0. turnIndex advances to 1.

**When:** Red captain calls `ban_character(lobbyId, "Jingliu")`
**Then:** Ban step recorded at sequence 1. turnIndex advances to 2.

**When:** Players complete all 22 turns (6 bans + 16 picks in BanMode Six pattern)
**Then:** After last pick, lobby automatically transitions to Equipping.

### Classic Draft: Timer Expiry Auto-Pick

**Given:** Active Classic draft, current step is Pick for Blue, autoRandomPick=false
**When:** Turn timer expires and any member calls `timer_expiry_classic(lobbyId)`
**Then:** Pick step recorded with characterName="EMPTY", eidolon=0, actorUserId=0 (system), costPaid=0. turnIndex advances.

### Classic Draft: Timer Expiry Auto-Ban

**Given:** Active Classic draft, current step is Ban for Red, autoRandomPick=false
**When:** Turn timer expires and member calls `timer_expiry_classic(lobbyId)`
**Then:** Ban step recorded with characterName="SKIP", actorUserId=0 (system). turnIndex advances.

### Classic Draft: Timer Expiry with autoRandomPick

**Given:** Active Classic draft, current step is Pick for Blue, autoRandomPick=true, requireOwnership=false
**When:** Turn timer expires
**Then:** System deterministically selects from available pool using hash `(turnIndex * 31 + lobbyId) % poolSize`. Pick step recorded with selected character, actorUserId=0.

### Classic Draft: Mirror Picks

**Given:** Active Classic draft, allowMirrorPicks=true, Blue has already picked "Kafka"
**When:** Red captain calls `pick_character(lobbyId, "Kafka", 0)`
**Then:** Pick succeeds (mirror allowed). Kafka appears twice in steps.

**Given:** Active Classic draft, allowMirrorPicks=false, Blue has already picked "Kafka"
**When:** Red captain calls `pick_character(lobbyId, "Kafka", 0)`
**Then:** Throws "Character already picked."

### Classic Draft: Banned Character Cannot Be Picked

**Given:** Active Classic draft, "Kafka" was banned in ban phase
**When:** Blue captain calls `pick_character(lobbyId, "Kafka", 0)`
**Then:** Throws "Character is banned and cannot be picked." (even with allowMirrorPicks=true)

### Auction Draft: Nomination and Bidding

**Given:** Lobby in Auction mode, BanMode Four, ban phase complete, isAuctionPhase=true, nextNominatorTeam=Blue, characterBudget=100
**When:** Blue captain calls `nominate_character(lobbyId, "Kafka", 0)` (base cost 10)
**Then:** Nominate step recorded. MatchSession: currentNomination="Kafka", currentBidAmount=10, currentBidTeam=Blue.

**When:** Red captain calls `place_bid(lobbyId, 15)` (minimumBidRaise=1, so min bid=11)
**Then:** Bid step recorded. currentBidAmount=15, currentBidTeam=Red.

**When:** Blue captain calls `pass_bid(lobbyId)`
**Then:** AuctionSold step: Kafka sold to Red for 15. teamRedCharBudget decremented by 15. redCharactersWon incremented. Steal-skip: Blue nominated and Red won, so Blue keeps nomination turn (steal).

### Auction Draft: Steal-Skip Logic

**Given:** Blue nominates, Blue wins the auction (Red passes immediately)
**Then:** Normal rotation: nextNominatorTeam = Red

**Given:** Blue nominates, Red outbids and wins the auction (Blue passes)
**Then:** Steal: nextNominatorTeam = Blue (nominator keeps turn because opponent "spent" their slot)

### Auction Draft: End at 8 Characters Per Team

**Given:** Auction phase, blueCharactersWon=7, redCharactersWon=8
**When:** Blue's 8th character is sold (AuctionSold)
**Then:** Both teams at 8+. Lobby transitions to Equipping.

### Auction Draft: Budget Enforcement

**Given:** Auction phase, Blue's charBudget=5, base cost for "Kafka"=10
**When:** Blue captain calls `nominate_character(lobbyId, "Kafka", 0)`
**Then:** Throws "Not enough budget to nominate this character."

**Given:** Auction phase, Red's charBudget=12, currentBidAmount=10, minimumBidRaise=5
**When:** Red captain calls `place_bid(lobbyId, 15)` (min=15, Red has 12)
**Then:** Throws "Bid exceeds your remaining character budget."

### Auction Draft: Timer Expiry (Nomination Phase)

**Given:** Auction phase, no currentNomination, nextNominatorTeam=Blue
**When:** Timer expires
**Then:** System auto-nominates EMPTY CHARACTER at cost 0 for Blue. currentNomination="EMPTY", currentBidTeam=Blue.

### Auction Draft: Timer Expiry (Bidding Phase)

**Given:** Auction phase, currentNomination="Kafka", currentBidTeam=Blue, currentBidAmount=10
**When:** Timer expires
**Then:** Auto-pass for Red. AuctionSold: Kafka sold to Blue for 10. Budget decremented, won count incremented.

### Coach Blocked From All Actions

**Given:** Blue coach slot member in an active draft
**When:** Coach calls `pick_character`, `ban_character`, `nominate_character`, `place_bid`, `pass_bid`, `equip_lightcone`, `arrange_lineup`, or `confirm_lineup`
**Then:** Each throws "Coaches cannot perform draft actions." (or the action-specific variant like "Coaches cannot equip lightcones.")

### Referee Undo

**Given:** Active draft, refereeCanUndo=true, referee is a lobby member, turnIndex=3
**When:** Referee calls `undo_last_step(lobbyId)`
**Then:** Highest-sequence step deleted. Undo audit step inserted with originalSequenceId=2. turnIndex decremented to 2. Timer reset.

### Referee Undo: Cannot Undo at turnIndex=0

**Given:** Draft just started, turnIndex=0
**When:** Referee calls `undo_last_step(lobbyId)`
**Then:** Throws "No steps to undo."

### Referee Undo: Reverts Auction Phase Transition

**Given:** Auction mode, ban phase just completed (isAuctionPhase=true), turnIndex = banSequenceLength
**When:** Referee calls `undo_last_step(lobbyId)`
**Then:** turnIndex decremented below ban sequence length. isAuctionPhase reverts to false.

### Pause and Resume: Player

**Given:** Active draft, allowPlayerPause=true, pausesUsedBlue=0
**When:** Blue player calls `pause_draft(lobbyId)`
**Then:** Pause step recorded with timeRemainingMs. timerState.isPaused=true. pausesUsedBlue incremented to 1.

**When:** Same Blue player calls `resume_draft(lobbyId)`
**Then:** timerState.isPaused=false. accumulatedPauseMs = timeRemainingMs from Pause step. turnStartAt reset.

### Pause and Resume: Referee

**Given:** Active draft, refereeCanPause=true
**When:** Referee calls `pause_draft(lobbyId)`
**Then:** Pause step recorded. timerState.isPaused=true. pausesUsedBlue and pausesUsedRed NOT incremented.

### Pause: 3-Per-Team Limit

**Given:** Active draft, allowPlayerPause=true, pausesUsedBlue=3
**When:** Blue player calls `pause_draft(lobbyId)`
**Then:** Throws "Blue team has used all 3 pauses."

### Equipping: Lightcone Budget

**Given:** Equipping stage, Blue's lcBudget=20, lightcone costs 15
**When:** Blue captain calls `equip_lightcone(lobbyId, "Kafka", "Patience Is All You Need", 1)`
**Then:** EquipLightcone step recorded with costPaid=15. teamBlueLcBudget reduced to 5.

**When:** Blue captain tries to equip another LC costing 10
**Then:** Throws "Not enough LC budget."

### Equipping: Arrange and Confirm Lineup

**Given:** Equipping stage
**When:** Blue captain calls `arrange_lineup(lobbyId, '["Kafka","Jingliu","Blade","Bronya"]')`
**Then:** ArrangeLineup step recorded with positions JSON.

**When:** Blue captain calls `confirm_lineup(lobbyId)`
**Then:** ConfirmLineup step recorded with confirmed=true.

### Budget Rollover on Advance Stage

**Given:** Drafting stage, Blue charBudget=30 remaining, Blue lcBudget=50
**When:** Host calls `advance_stage(lobbyId)`
**Then:** Lobby transitions to Equipping. Blue lcBudget = 50 + 30 = 80. Blue charBudget = 0. System chat: "Draft complete. Stage: Equipping"

### Advance Stage: Scoring Blocked

**Given:** Lobby in Scoring stage
**When:** Host calls `advance_stage(lobbyId)`
**Then:** Throws "Use finalize_match_result to transition from Scoring to Finished."

### System Chat on Stage Transitions

**Given:** Host calls `start_draft`
**Then:** System chat message: "Draft has started!"

**Given:** Host calls `advance_stage` from Drafting
**Then:** System chat message: "Draft complete. Stage: Equipping"

**Given:** Host calls `advance_stage` from Equipping
**Then:** System chat message: "Lineups set. Stage: Scoring"

## Edge Cases

| Case | Expected Behavior | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Pick EMPTY character manually | Costs 0, recorded normally | Frontend renders as "No Pick" |
| Ban SKIP on timer expiry | Recorded as Ban with characterName="SKIP" | Only when autoRandomPick=false |
| autoRandomPick with empty available pool | Falls back to EMPTY/SKIP | All characters banned+picked |
| Nominate EMPTY in auction | Bypasses won/banned checks, cost=0 | Teams with 0 budget nominate EMPTY |
| Bid on EMPTY character | Allowed, min raise still enforced | Wasteful but not blocked |
| Timer expiry with paused timer | Not validated (timer paused = client doesn't fire) | Server only checks elapsed time |
| Undo the only step (turnIndex=1) | Deletes step, turnIndex goes to 0 | Further undo blocked ("No steps to undo") |
| Undo auction phase boundary | isAuctionPhase reverts to false | If newTurnIndex < draftSequence.length |
| Resume by different teammate (not original pauser, not referee) | Rejected | Only referee or original pauser |
| Captain leaves mid-draft | No captain on team; any team member can now act | Captain check passes if no captain exists |
| arrange_lineup with invalid JSON | Rejected | "positions must be a valid JSON array of strings." |
| advance_stage from Waiting | Rejected | ensureHostOrAbove passes but stage check fails |
| advance_stage from Finished | Rejected | "Cannot advance stage from Finished." |
| Duplicate LobbyMember.isCaptain on same team | First captain wins captain check | Only one captain should exist per team |
| Auction sold when only one team needs characters | Normal flow, no short circuit | Other team's won count already at 8, one team still filling |
