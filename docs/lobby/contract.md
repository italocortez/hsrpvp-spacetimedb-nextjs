# Lobby System

**Architecture:** [architecture.md](architecture.md)

## Feature Overview

The lobby system manages the lifecycle of match rooms where players assemble, configure settings, assign teams, and ready up before entering the draft phase. It handles lobby creation with preset support, join/leave flows with password protection, team slot assignment with capacity enforcement, ready-up coordination, captain designation, and administrative actions (kick/ban/close). Tournament-controlled lobbies inherit locked settings while allowing QoL adjustments. A preset system lets privileged users save and reuse lobby configurations.

**Flow:**
1. Authenticate caller via `getAuthenticatedUser`
2. If `presetId > 0`: validate preset exists
3. D-22: `ensureNotInLobby` — reject if user is already in any lobby
4. Generate deterministic 6-char join code (Jackbox-style, hash-based, retry on collision)
5. D-23: `ensureGuestRestrictions` — guests cannot create Ranked lobbies
6. D-23: If guest, force `rosterVisibility=ClosedNoRating`
7. D-42: If Ranked, force `allowMirrorPicks=false`
8. Insert Lobby row with `stage=Waiting`, `currentPlayerCount=1`
9. Insert LobbyMember for host: `isReferee=true`, `lobbySlot=Spectator` (D-24, D-27)
10. If private (`!isPublic` and password non-empty): insert LobbyPassword row

**Expected State Changes:**
- Lobby row inserted (stage=Waiting, currentPlayerCount=1)
- LobbyMember row inserted (host, isReferee=true, lobbySlot=Spectator, isConfirmed=false, isCaptain=false)
- LobbyPassword row inserted (private lobbies only)

**Error Cases:**
| Condition | Error Message |
|-----------|--------------|
| presetId > 0 but not found | "Preset not found." |
| User already in a lobby (D-22) | "You are already in a lobby. Leave it before creating or joining another." |

## Edge Cases

| Case | Expected Behavior | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Create lobby with presetId=0 | Preset validation skipped, config from args | 0 is sentinel for "no preset" |
| Create private lobby with empty password | No LobbyPassword row inserted | Password length check: `password.length > 0` |
| Join code collision after 10 retries | Throws "Could not generate a unique join code" | Extremely unlikely with 36^6 = ~2.2B codes |
| Reconnect to Drafting lobby when already online | No-op (silently returns) | Prevents duplicate member rows |
| Leave non-Waiting lobby (last member) | Leave succeeds, no auto-close | Auto-close only triggers in Waiting stage |
| Ban user who is already banned | Duplicate LobbyBan insert (may fail on PK) | Edge: should check existing ban first |
| set_team_slot during Drafting | Rejected by stage guard | Slots frozen once draft begins |
| unconfirm_ready during Drafting | Rejected by stage guard | Ready state locked during draft |
| Guest calls update_lobby_settings with Ranked | Forced to Casual server-side | Guest override applies regardless of input |
| disconnectForfeitSeconds=0 in create/update | Stored as undefined (not set) | 0 is sentinel for "no timeout" |
| Tournament lobby update_lobby_settings | Locked fields silently retain values | No error — free fields still update |
| Preset name exactly 50 chars | Accepted | Boundary: 1-50 inclusive |
| Preset name 51 chars | Rejected | "Preset name must be between 1 and 50 characters." |
| Moderator editing another moderator's preset | Allowed | Mods can edit mod/TO presets (not system) |
| Host is auto-referee | LobbyMember.isReferee=true at creation | No explicit set_referee reducer needed |
| lobby_gc on Waiting lobby idle > 30 min | Hard-deleted via `_hardDeleteLobby` | `lastActivityAt` compared to current time |
| lobby_gc on Finished lobby idle > 30 min | Hard-deleted via `_hardDeleteLobby` | Safety net for abandoned closed lobbies |
| lobby_gc on Drafting/Equipping/Scoring/AwaitingResult | NOT touched — GC skips active stages | Active lobbies cleaned by finalization cascade, not GC |
| Tournament with countTowardsMmr=true | Lobby matchType=Ranked | D-67: matchType derived from tournament flag |
| Tournament with countTowardsMmr=false | Lobby matchType=Casual | D-67: matchType derived from tournament flag |
| Duplicate bracketMatchId (non-Finished lobby exists) | Throws "A lobby already exists for this bracket match." | D-45: iterates all lobbies checking bracketMatchId + stage |
| Duplicate bracketMatchId (only Finished lobby exists) | New lobby created successfully | Finished lobbies do not block recreation |
