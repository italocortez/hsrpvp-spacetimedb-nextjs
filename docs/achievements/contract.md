# Achievements & Titles

## Feature Overview

Admins and Moderators can define achievements with flexible, data-driven criteria. The system auto-awards achievements during match finalization when a player's stats satisfy all criteria (AND logic). TOs and Moderators can also manually award achievements. Players can display an earned achievement as a title on their profile.

## Auto-Award Pipeline

The achievement checker runs at step 16.5 of `runFinalization`, after all stat increments (PlayerStat, PlayerCharacterStat, MmrRating, Leaderboard) but before bracket advancement.

**For each non-manual achievement, for each participant:**
1. Skip if user already has it (by_user_achievement index)
2. Skip if global cap reached (by_achievement count vs maxAwards)
3. Load criteria rows (by_achievement index); skip if empty
4. Evaluate ALL criteria (AND logic) — all must pass
5. Award if all pass

**Criteria resolution:**
| statTable | Aggregation | Filter support |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| PlayerStat | Sum across filtered rows | gameMode, matchType |
| PlayerCharacterStat | Sum across filtered rows | gameMode, matchType, characterName |
| MmrRating | Max across all rows (best-mode) | None |

## Acceptance Scenarios

### Admin Creates Achievement with Criteria
**Given:** Admin user exists
**When:** Admin calls `create_achievement` then `add_achievement_criteria`
**Then:** Achievement row created with correct fields; AchievementCriteria row linked by FK

### Moderator Creates and Manages Achievement
**Given:** Moderator user exists
**When:** Moderator calls `create_achievement`, `update_achievement`, `add_achievement_criteria`, `remove_achievement_criteria`
**Then:** All succeed — Moderator has same CRUD permissions as Admin

### Moderator Cannot Delete Achievement
**Given:** Moderator user exists, achievement exists
**When:** Moderator calls `delete_achievement`
**Then:** Rejected with "Forbidden: Requires Admin privileges."

### Duplicate Name Rejected
**Given:** Achievement "Veteran" exists
**When:** Any Moderator+ calls `create_achievement` with name="Veteran"
**Then:** Rejected with "Achievement with this name already exists."

### Manual Award with Duplicate Prevention
**Given:** UserB already has achievement X
**When:** Admin calls `manual_award_achievement` for UserB + achievement X
**Then:** Rejected with "User has already earned this achievement."

### Global Cap Enforcement
**Given:** Achievement with maxAwards=1, UserA already awarded
**When:** Admin calls `manual_award_achievement` for UserB
**Then:** Rejected with global award limit message

### Criteria Lock After Award
**Given:** Achievement X has criteria, UserB has earned it
**When:** Admin calls `add_achievement_criteria` or `remove_achievement_criteria` for achievement X
**Then:** Rejected with "Cannot modify criteria: players have already earned this achievement."

### Set and Clear Display Title
**Given:** UserB has earned achievement X
**When:** UserB calls `set_displayed_achievement` with achievementId=X, then with achievementId=0
**Then:** User.displayedAchievementId set to X, then cleared to null

### Cascade Delete
**Given:** Achievement with criteria rows, UserAchievement rows, and a user displaying it
**When:** Admin calls `delete_achievement`
**Then:** All criteria rows, all UserAchievement rows deleted; User.displayedAchievementId cleared; Achievement row deleted

### Moderator Cannot Set Other User's Title
**Given:** Moderator exists, UserB exists with earned achievement
**When:** Moderator calls `set_displayed_achievement` with targetUserId=UserB
**Then:** Rejected with "Forbidden: Only admins can set titles for other users."

### Permission Guards
**Given:** Guest user, regular User, Moderator, Admin
**When:** Each calls achievement reducers
**Then:** Guest rejected on all; User rejected on all except set_displayed_achievement (own); Moderator rejected on delete + set other's title; Admin unrestricted

## Edge Cases

| Case | Expected Behavior | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Empty achievement name | Rejected: "must not be empty" | Whitespace-only also rejected (trim check) |
| maxAwards=0 | Effectively blocks all awards (cap check: 0 >= 0) | Valid but unusual |
| Achievement with no criteria (non-manual) | Never auto-awarded (empty criteria → skip) | Must add criteria for auto-award to work |
| Manual-only achievement | Skipped by checker entirely | isManualOnly filter in checker |
| Unknown statTable in criteria | Checker logs warning, returns false | Does not crash finalization |
| Unknown statField in criteria | getField returns undefined → sum is 0 | Logs warning |
| rarity param required on update | Callers pass existing rarity to leave unchanged | SpacetimeDB enum types don't support .optional() |

| User.displayedAchievementId | Achievement.id | FK reference | Reads |
| manual_award_achievement | Tournament/TournamentEnrolled | TO scope check via organizer_id index | Reads |
| delete_achievement cascade | User table | Clears displayedAchievementId | Writes |
