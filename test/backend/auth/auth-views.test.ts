/**
 * Auth Views (Security Views) integration tests.
 *
 * SpacetimeDB views are virtual projections — they are NOT queryable via
 * `spacetime sql` CLI ("no such table"). Views are only accessible via
 * WebSocket subscriptions, but views don't generate typed client bindings
 * (conn.db.ViewName is undefined). This means automated testing of view
 * projections is currently not possible via the integration test harness.
 *
 * Coverage is provided by:
 *   - UAT test 10 (manual verification of view_my_profile in browser)
 *   - Frontend integration (useAuth subscribes to view_my_profile, view_my_identity)
 *   - The views themselves are thin SQL projections of already-tested tables
 *
 * These placeholder tests document the expected behavior and serve as
 * anchors for future automation when the SDK supports view bindings.
