# HSRPVP — Honkai Star Rail PVP Platform

## What This Is

A competitive Honkai Star Rail PVP platform where players draft characters, compete in matches and tournaments, track their performance, and manage their in-game rosters. Built on SpacetimeDB for real-time multiplayer sync with a Next.js frontend. The platform aims to replace external tournament tools (like Challonge) with a purpose-built, HSR-native competitive experience.

## Core Value

Players can organize, play, and track competitive HSR matches and tournaments in one place — from drafting to scoring to leaderboards — without relying on external tools.

### Active

<!-- Current scope: v1 frontend milestone. v0.5 backend is complete. -->

**v1 Frontend Milestone** (next)
- [ ] Frontend UI for all backend features (lobby, draft, tournament, profile, admin)
- [ ] Test harness modernization for SDK 2.1.0 (Phase 14)

### Out of Scope

<!-- Explicit boundaries. Includes reasoning to prevent re-adding. -->

- HoYoverse API roster import — unclear if API supports it, defer to future milestone
- Computer vision screenshot roster import — high complexity, future milestone
- Season implementation for leaderboards — schema supports it, UI/logic deferred
- Real-time voice/video chat — out of platform scope
- Mobile native app — web-first
- Payment/monetization — not needed for competitive platform
- Chat message persistence — ephemeral by design, no replay of chat

## Context

- Backend (v0.5) is complete: 67 tables, ~155 reducers, 32 server-side views, 673+ tests across 21 phases
- SpacetimeDB SDK 2.1.0 with TypeScript backend, Next.js 15 frontend with HeroUI
- SpacetimeDB handles all persistent state and real-time sync via WebSocket subscriptions
- Privacy enforced via PRIVATE tables + 32 named views (no raw private table subscriptions)
- Trusted server identity pattern for privileged operations (Discord linking, role management)
- Audit columns (createdAt/By, updatedAt/By) standard on all tables
- UserPrivate isolation (Phase 12): profile data accessed only via view_my_profile
- All reducer calls use .catch() pattern (Phase 12.2), no _then() callbacks
- 19 feature doc sets normalized (architecture.md + contract.md) with standardized templates (Phase 13)
- Frontend/UI is the next milestone (v1)

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: SpacetimeDB TypeScript backend, Next.js frontend — established, no changes
- **Reducers**: Must be deterministic — no network, filesystem, timers, or random
- **Data access**: All reads via table subscriptions, never reducer return values
- **Image hosting**: Imgur for match screenshot uploads (external dependency)
- **Auth**: SpacetimeDB identity + Discord OAuth via NextAuth — established pattern
- **Game modes**: Memory of Chaos, Apocalyptic Shadow, Anomaly Arbitration — each with different scoring

## Key Decisions

<!-- Decisions that constrain future work. Add throughout project lifecycle. -->

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Manual roster entry first | HoYoverse API availability uncertain; manual is reliable | Implemented (Phase 2) |
| Imgur for screenshot hosting | Avoids storing images in SpacetimeDB; public URLs sufficient for verification | Implemented (Phase 5) |
| Ephemeral chat via event table | Keeps match data lean; chat not needed for replay | Implemented (Phase 9) |
| Per-game-mode MMR with equal-weight global | Reflects different skill sets per mode while giving one composite rank | Implemented (Phase 5) |
| Tournament settings override user roster visibility | Tournament integrity > personal preference | Implemented (Phase 6) |
| Role-based TO access | Prevents spam tournaments while allowing community organizing | Implemented (Phase 3) |
| Configurable disconnect behavior | Different contexts (casual vs tournament) need different handling | Implemented (Phase 10) |
| Backend-only milestone | Solid table design first, UI in separate milestone | v0.5 complete |
| UserPrivate isolation | Profile data only via view_my_profile; no direct table subscription | Implemented (Phase 12) |
| .catch() reducer error pattern | Replaces _then() callbacks after SDK 2.1.0 upgrade | Implemented (Phase 12.2) |
| Matrix-based account rating | Vertical (eidolon depth) + horizontal (archetype coverage) with admin-tunable config | Implemented (Phase 11) |
| Flat columns over config structs | Filterable data uses flat columns; LobbyConfig can be reworked | Convention |
