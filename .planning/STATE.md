# Session State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-12)

**Core value:** Players can organize, play, and track competitive HSR matches and tournaments in one place — from drafting to scoring to leaderboards — without relying on external tools.
**Current focus:** v0.9 Frontend Milestone — Phase 15 (Backend pre-work) ready to plan.

## Position

**Milestone:** v0.9 Frontend (phases 15–41, plus 12 deferred MOBILE XX.1 phases)
**Current phase:** 15 — Backend pre-work
**Current plan:** None (phase not yet planned)
**Status:** Ready to plan
**Last activity:** 2026-04-12 — ROADMAP.md authored; 27 core phases locked per DECISIONS.md R1; coverage validated 84/84.

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (v0.9 milestone)

## Previous Milestone

v0.5 Backend Foundation shipped 2026-04-12. See `.planning/MILESTONES.md` and `milestones/v0.5-ROADMAP.md` for details.

## v0.9 Architectural Commitments (cross-phase, apply every phase)

Authoritative: `.planning/research/DECISIONS.md` (R1–R11) + `notes/v09-frontend-subscription-strategy.md` (Decisions 1–8).

- **R2** — No Web Worker; main-thread prefetch only via `requestIdleCallback`.
- **R4** — Single-responsive-DOM default. Dual-DOM ONLY at phases 27 (Calendar), 31 (Match Drafting), 35 (Tournament brackets).
- **R7** — Fork `@g-loot/react-tournament-brackets` day one in Phase 34 (strip `styled-components`, drop `SVGViewer`).
- **R8** — Component hygiene rules enforced from Phase 16 onward: thin page files, viewport-agnostic children, Tailwind responsive for sizing/spacing only, state in hooks, layout-agnostic component props.
- **R9** — Phase 16 resolves 5 pre-decisions: `experimental.typedRoutes: true`, Next ≥15.2.3 (CVE-2025-29927), Pattern E sibling dual-DOM, positive-list middleware matcher (excl. `/sw.js`, `_next/*`, API), desktop SSR default.
- **Energy ceiling** 102,500/month maincloud; `tools/energy-model.js` pre-merge check.
- **Single data plane** — SpacetimeDB subscriptions only. No SSR data plane, no REST bridge.
- **Browser support** — Chrome/Edge/Firefox; Safari defensively gated to image-only tier with dismissible banner.

## v0.5 Conventions (carry forward)

- costSetId=0 sentinel for default cost set
- teamGroupId=0 sentinel in reducer args (u32 not optional)
- winnerId=0 sentinel for draw
- Flat columns over config structs for filterable data
- UserPrivate isolation — profile data only via `view_my_profile`
- `.catch()` reducer error pattern (no `_then()` callbacks)
- BigInt micros as strings for timestamp params in reducers
- Sentinel values for optional u8/u32 reducer params (255/0)

## Decisions

Recent v0.9-scope decisions:

- Phase structure 15–41 locked (27 core phases, data/UX pair pattern).
- `team_builder_draft` table promoted INTO v0.9 scope (Phase 19); previously "out of scope".
- Authed base layer minimized to `user` + `hsr_account` only (R3); feature pages own own subs.

Full v0.5 decision archive in `milestones/v0.5-ROADMAP.md`.

## Blockers

None at kickoff. Open items for phase-time research tracked in `.planning/research/DECISIONS.md` "Open items for phase-time research":

1. Spine `skeleton.scaleY = -1` workaround (Phase 31)
2. Cursor broadcast throttle rate lock (Phase 30)
3. Imgur rate-limit fallback / Discord-bot storage plan (Phase 32)
4. Vercel preview Discord OAuth callback URL strategy (Phase 21)
5. FullStory sampling strategy (Phase 31 telemetry)
6. React 19 peer confirmation for forked bracket lib (Phase 34)
7. Recurring availability slot algorithm + DST + overlap (Phase 26)
